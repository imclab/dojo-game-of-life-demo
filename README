The Game of Life with Dojo

This demo uses version 1.5 of the Dojo Toolkit (http://dojotoolkit.org) to create a version of Conways Game of Life. More information about the Game of Life can be found on wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life.

The game demonstrates a number of features of the Dojo toolkit including:
 * Dijits, used for the game controls.
 * An MVC approach to client side Javascript development, including dojo.data for the model, dijits for the view and a custom controller. Whilst the demo has been built as a standalone Javascript app the model could be easily adapted to use Dojo.data to communicate with your backend of choice.
 * Dojo publish and subscribe framework for communicating between the model, view and controller.
 * Two views, one built using standard HTML tables and one built using dojox.gfx vector graphics API.
 * An example project layout and introduction to the build system.
